# hello-clojurescript

Sample clojurescript projects:

* plain-clojurescript: just needs clojurescript installed
* simple-lein: just needs clojure and lein installed
* browser-repl-lein: same as above, but can execute repl commands on the browser
* lighttable-repl: same as above, but Light Table has an embedded browser and any selected text will serve as command source.
